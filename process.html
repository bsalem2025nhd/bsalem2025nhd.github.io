		<h2>Process Paper</h2>
			<p class="process-paper">My topic for this year’s National History Day project is about how the Third Estate during the French Revolution fought back against the norm to gain their hard-earned rights and free themselves from unfair taxes and treatment. I chose this topic because we learned about it in class and also I found it quite interesting. It relates to this year’s theme of Rights and Responsibilities because the people in the Third Estate fought to have more rights and less responsibilities. I conducted research mainly online, using encyclopedic websites like Britannica, as well as sites specifically tailored to the French Revolution. My project is a website, and I am using National History Day’s provided website builder. My historical argument is that while the Third Estate was initially successful, France soon reverted to monarchy with the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. My topic is significant in history because it sent a wave of ripples throughout Europe and the world for revolution.</p>
