		<h2>Rights and Responsibilities: The Third Estate</h2>

		<p class="big-block-of-text-about-the-french-revolution">The French Revolution was one of the major events in the foundation of Europe today. It all started in the late 1700s, when working conditions for peasants were horrible and the government did not really care. The economy was going through an awful downturn, and more and more people started to oppose the government. When King Louis XVI (16) came to power, it was a well-known secret that he was quite a weak monarch. People just couldn't stand the situation any longer, and they decided to rebel. After Charles-Alexandre de Calonne called a meeting of the Estates-General, where representatives from the First Estate (clergy), Second Estate (nobles), and Third Estate (commoners) meet to discuss whatever matter is at hand. The Third Estate gets quite angered about how the vote is divided by estate and not population. This is because the Third Estate makes up around 97% of the population, while the other two make up around 3%. Because of this, the Third Estate leaves without the other two. They declare themselves the National Assembly. On June 20th, 1789, the National Assembly was locked out of their meeting-place by royal officials. In response, the National Assembly collectively used the king's indoor tennis court. The members take the Tennis Court Oath, swearing they wouldn't disperse until France had a new constitution. The king didn't like this, and he wanted to get rid of the whole debacle. But, this led to the Great Fear of July 1789, where people were very worried that royals would get rid of the Third Estate entirely. So, they stormed and seized the royal Bastille prison, which was their proud symbol of tyranny. Things started to boil over, and France declared war on Austria in just one of the many French Revolutionary wars fought by France during this time period. In September of 1792, the National Convention, which is a new assembly, abolishes the government of monarchy, and replaces it with a republic instead. In January of 1793, the convention judges the king, Louis XVI. After some deliberation, he gets executed for treason against France. This led to the Reign of Terror, where Marie-Antoinette, the king's wife, is also executed among many others by guillotine. In July of 1793, the writer for <i>L'Ami du Peuple</i> (a revolutionary newspaper), Jean-Paul Marat, was stabbed in his home by Charlotte Corday and instantly became a martyr for the cause of the people. Maximilien Robespierre, the leader of the Reign of Terror, was soon also executed, meaning the end of the Reign of Terror. The National Convention is then dissolved, making way for Napoleon Bonaparte to rule France as consul, then as emperor.</p>
